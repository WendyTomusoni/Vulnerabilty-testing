Overview

The Simple Vulnerability Scanning Tool is a Python script that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities. It checks for open ports, outdated software versions, and common misconfigurations.

Project Name : Simple Vulnerability Scanning Tool

Objectives

- To identify open ports on a target host.
- To detect outdated software versions that might have security vulnerabilities.
- To find common misconfigurations in web applications that could be exploited.

Key Activities

- Scanning specified ports on a target host to check if they are open.
- Checking versions of specified software to determine if they are outdated.
- Scanning for common misconfigurations by accessing known vulnerable URLs.

Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Socket module for port scanning
- Subprocess module for checking software versions
- Requests module for checking web configurations

Key Insights

- Open Ports: Identifying open ports helps in securing the network by closing unnecessary ones.
- Outdated Software: Ensuring software is up to date reduces the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited.
- Misconfigurations: Common misconfigurations can provide attackers easy access to sensitive information.
